# A bare metal programming guide

This guide is written for developers who wish to start programming
microcontrollers using GCC compiler and bare metal approach. We are going to
use a
[Nucleo-F429ZI](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f429zi.html)

Mouser](https://eu.mouser.com/ProductDetail/STMicroelectronics/NUCLEO-F429ZI?qs=mKNKSX85ZJcE6FU0UkiXTA%3D%3D)).
But basic principles would be applicable to any other microcontroller. 

In this guide, I'll show how to program a microcontroller using just a compiler
and a datasheet, nothing else. Later I'll explain what are the vendor's CMSIS
headers, how and why they should be used. We'll learn how to blink LEDs, how to
redirect `printf()` to UART, how to set up the system clock, how to use
interrupts, and even how to run a web server with device dashboard.

## Introduction

A microcontroller (uC, or MCU) is a small computer. Typically it has CPU, RAM,
flash to store firmware code, and a bunch of pins that stick out. Some pins are
used to power the MCU, usually marked as GND (ground) and VCC pins. Other pins
are used to communicate with the MCU, by means of high/low voltage applied to
those pins. One of the simplest ways of communication is an LED attached to a
pin: one LED contact is attached to the ground pin (GND), and another contact
is attached to a signal pin via a current-limiting resistor.  A firmware code
can set high or low voltage on a signal pin, making LED blink:

### Memory and registers

The 32-bit address space of the MCU is divided by regions. For example, some
region of memory is mapped to the internal MCU flash at a specific address.
Firmware code instructions are read and executed by reading from that memory region. Another region is
RAM, which is also mapped to a specific address. We can read and write any
values to the RAM region.

From STM32F429 datasheet, we can take a look at section 2.3.1 and learn
that RAM region starts at address 0x20000000 and has size of 192KB. From section
2.4 we can learn that flash is mapped at address 0x08000000. Our MCU has
2MB flash, so flash and RAM regions are located like this:

<img src="images/mem.svg" />

From the datasheet we can also learn that there are many more memory regions.
Their address ranges are given in the section 2.3 "Memory Map". For example,
there is a "GPIOA" region that starts at 0x40020000 and has length of 1KB.

These memory regions correspond to a different "peripherals" inside the MCU -
a piece of silicon circuitry that make certain pins behave in a special way.
A peripheral memory region is a collection of 32-bit **registers**. Each
register is a 4-byte memory range at a certain address, that maps to a certain
function of the given peripheral. By writing values into a register - in other
words, by writing a 32-bit value at a certain memory address, we can control
how given peripheral should behave. By reading registers, we can read back
peripheral's data or configuration.

There are many different peripherals. One of the simpler ones are GPIO
(General Purpose Input Output), which allow user to set MCU pins
into "output mode" and set high or low voltage on them. Or, set pins into
an "input mode" and read voltage values from them. There is a UART peripheral
which can transmit and receive serial data over two pins using RS232 protocol.
There are many other peripherals.

Often, there are multiple "instances" of the same peripheral, for example
GPIOA, GPIOB, ... which control different set of MCU pins. Likewise, there
could be UART1, UART2, ... which allow to implement multiple UART channels.
On Nucleo-F429, there are several GPIO and UART peripherals.

For example, GPIOA
peripheral starts at 0x40020000, and we can find GPIO register description in
section 8.4. The datasheet says that `GPIOA_MODER` register has offset 0, that
means that it's address is `0x40020000 + 0`, and this is the format of the
register:

<img src="images/moder.png" style="max-width: 100%" />

The datasheet shows that the 32-bit MODER register is a collection of 2-bit
values, 16 in total. Therefore, one MODER register controls 16 physical pins,
Bits 0-1 control pin 0, bits 2-3 control pin 1, and so on. The 2-bit value
encodes pin mode: 0 means input, 1 means output, 2 means "alternate function" -
some specific behavior described elsewhere, and 3 means analog. Since the
peripheral name is "GPIOA", then pins are named "A0", "A1", etc. For peripheral
"GPIOB", pin naming would be "B0", "B1", ...

If we write 32-bit value `0` to the register MODER, we'll set all 16 pins,
from A0 to A15, to input mode:

```c
  * (volatile uint32_t *) (0x40020000 + 0) = 0;  // Set A0-A15 to input mode
```

By setting individual bits, we can selectively set specific pins to a desired
mode. For example, this snippet sets pin A3 to output mode:

```c
  * (volatile uint32_t *) (0x40020000 + 0) &= ~(3 << 6);  // CLear bits 6-7
  * (volatile uint32_t *) (0x40020000 + 0) |= 3 << 6;     // Set bits 6-7 to 1
```

Some registers are not mapped to the MCU peripherals, but they are mapped to
the ARM CPU configuration and control. For example, there is a "Reset at clock
control" unit (RCC), described in section 6 of the datasheet. It describes
registers that allow to set systems clock and other things.

## Human-readable peripherals programming

In the previous section we have learned that we can read and write peripheral
register by direct accessing certain memory addresses. Let's look at the
snippet that sets pin A3 to output mode:

```c
  * (volatile uint32_t *) (0x40020000 + 0) &= ~(3 << 6);  // CLear bits 6-7
  * (volatile uint32_t *) (0x40020000 + 0) |= 3 << 6;     // Set bits 6-7 to 1
```

That is pretty cryptic. Without extensive comments, such code would be quite
hard to understand. We can rewrite this code to a much more readable form.  The
idea is to represent the whole peripheral as a structure that contains 32-bit
fields. Let's see what registers exist for the GPIO peripheral in the section
8.4 of the datasheet. They are MODER, OTYPER, OSPEEDR, PUPDR, IDR, ODR, BSRR,
LCKR, AFR. Their offsets are with offsets 0, 4, 8, etc... . That means we can
represent them as a structure with 32-bit fields, and make a define for GPIOA:

```c
struct gpio {
  volatile uint32_t MODER, OTYPER, OSPEEDR, PUPDR, IDR, ODR, BSRR, LCKR, AFR[2];
};

#define GPIOA ((struct gpio *) 0x40020000)
```

Then, for setting GPIO pin mode, we can define a function:

```c
// Enum values are per datasheet: 0, 1, 2, 3
enum {GPIO_MODE_INPUT, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT, GPIO_MODE_AF, GPIO_MODE_ANALOG};

static inline void gpio_set_mode(struct gpio *gpio, uint8_t pin, uint8_t mode) {
  gpio->MODER &= ~(3U << (pin * 2));        // Clear existing setting
  gpio->MODER |= (mode & 3) << (pin * 2);   // Set new mode
}
```
Now, we can rewrite the snippet for A3 like this:

```c
gpio_set_mode(GPIOA, 3 /* pin */, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);  // Set A3 to output
```

Our MCU has several GPIO peripherals (also called "banks"): A, B, C, ... K.
From section 2.3 we can see that they are 1KB away from each other:
GPIOA is at address 0x40020000, GPIOB is at 0x40020400, and so on:

```c
#define GPIO(bank) ((struct gpio *) (0x40020000 + 0x400 * (bank)))
```

We can create pin numbering that includes the bank and the pin number.
To do that, we use 2-byte `uint16_t` value, where upper byte indicates
GPIO bank, and lower byte indicates pin number:

```c
#define PIN(bank, num) ((((bank) - 'A') << 8) | (num))
#define PINNO(pin) (pin & 255)
#define PINBANK(pin) (pin >> 8)
```

This way, we can specify pins for any GPIO bank:

```c
  uint16_t pin1 = PIN('A', 3);    // A3   - GPIOA pin 3
  uint16_t pin2 = PIN('G', 11);   // G11  - GPIOG pin 11
```

Let's rewrite the `gpio_set_mode()` function to take our pin specification:

```c
static inline void gpio_set_mode(uint16_t pin, uint8_t mode) {
  struct gpio *gpio = GPIO(PINBANK(pin)); // GPIO bank
  uint8_t n = PINNO(pin);                 // Pin number
  gpio->MODER &= ~(3U << (n * 2));        // Clear existing setting
  gpio->MODER |= (mode & 3) << (n * 2);   // Set new mode
}
```

Now the code for A3 is self-explanatory:

```c
  uint16_t pin = PIN('A', 3);            // Pin A3
  gpio_set_mode(pin, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);  // Set to output
```

Note that we have created a useful initial API for the GPIO peripheral. Other
peripherals, like UART (serial communication) and others - can be implemented
in a similar way. This is a good programming practice that makes code
self-explanatory and human readable.

## MCU boot and vector table

When STM32F429 MCU boots, it reads a so-called "vector table" from the
beginning of flash memory. A vector table is a concept common to all ARM MCUs.
That is a array of 32-bit addresses of interrupt handlers. First 16 entries
are reserved by ARM and are common to all ARM MCUs. The rest of interrupt
handlers are specific to the given MCU - these are interrupt handlers for
peripherals. Simpler MCUs with few peripherals have few interrupt handlers,
and more complex MCUs have many.

Vector table for STM32F429 is documented in Table 62. From there we can learn
that there are 91 peripheral handlers, in addition to the standard 16.

At this point, we are interested in the first two entries of the vector table,
because they play a key role in the MCU boot process. Those two first values
are: initial stack pointer, and an address of the boot function to execute
(a firmware entry point).

So now we know, that we must make sure that our firmware should be composed in
a way that the 2nd 32-bit value in the flash should contain an address of
out boot function. When MCU boots, it'll read that address from flash, and
jump to our boot function.


## Minimal firmware

Let's create a file `main.c`, and specify our boot function that initially does
nothing (falls into infinite loop), and specify a vector table that contains 16
standard entries and 91 STM32 entries. In your editor of choice, create
`main.c` file and copy/paste the following into `main.c` file:

```c
// Startup code
__attribute__((naked, noreturn)) void _reset(void) {
  for (;;) (void) 0;  // Infinite loop
}

// 16 standard and 91 STM32-specific handlers
__attribute__((section(".vectors"))) void (*tab[16 + 91])(void) = {
  0, _reset
};
```

For function `_reset()`, we have used GCC-specific attributes `naked` and
`noreturn` - they mean, standard function's prologue and epilogue should not
be created by the compiler, and that function does not return.

The `void (*tab[16 + 91])(void)` expression means: define an array of 16 + 91
pointers to functions, that return nothing (void) and take to arguments. Each
such function is an IRQ handler (Interrupt ReQuest handler). An array of those
handlers is called a vector table.

The vector table `tab` we put in a separate section called `.vectors` - that
we need later to tell the linker to put that section right at the beginning
of the generated firmware - and consecutively, at the beginning of flash
memory. We leave the rest of vector table filled with zeroes.

Note that we do not set the first entry in the vector table, which is an
initial value for the stack pointer. Why? Because we don't know the correct
value for it. We'll handle it later.

### Compilation

Let's compile our code:

```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -mcpu=cortex-m4 main.c -c
```

That works! The compilation produced a file `main.o` which contains
our minimal firmware that does nothing.  The `main.o` file is in ELF binary
format, which contains several sections. Let's see them:

```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -h main.o
...
Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
  0 .text         00000002  00000000  00000000  00000034  2**1
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
  1 .data         00000000  00000000  00000000  00000036  2**0
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  2 .bss          00000000  00000000  00000000  00000036  2**0
                  ALLOC
  3 .vectors      000001ac  00000000  00000000  00000038  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, RELOC, DATA
  4 .comment      0000004a  00000000  00000000  000001e4  2**0
                  CONTENTS, READONLY
  5 .ARM.attributes 0000002e  00000000  00000000  0000022e  2**0
                  CONTENTS, READONLY
```

Note that VMA/LMA addresses for sections are set to 0 - meaning, `main.o`
is not yet a complete firmware, because it does not contain the information
where those section should be loaded in the address space. We need to use
a linker to produce a full firmware `firmware.elf` from `main.o`.

The section .text contains firmware code, in our case it is just a _reset()
function, 2-bytes long - a jump instruction to its own address. There is
an empty `.data` section and an empty `.bss` section
(data that is initialized to zero) . Our firmware will be copied
to the flash region at offset 0x8000000, but our data section should reside
in RAM - therefore our `_reset()` function should copy the contents of the
`.data` section to RAM. Also it has to write zeroes to the whole `.bss`
section. Our `.data` and `.bss` sections are empty, but let's modify our
`_reset()` function anyway to handle them properly.

Also, our `_reset()` function should set the initial stack pointer, cause 
our vector table has zero in the corresponding entry at index 0.

In order to do all that, we must know where stack starts, and where data and
bss section start. This we can specify in the "linker script", which is a file
with the instructions to the linker, where to put various sections in the
address space, and which symbols to create.

### Linker script

Create a minimal linker script `link.ld`, and copy-paste contents from
[step-0-minimal/link.ld](step-0-minimal/link.ld). Below is the explanation:

```
ENTRY(_reset);
```

This line tells the linker the value of the "entry point" attribute in the
generated ELF header - so this is a duplicate to what a vector table has.  This
is an aid for a debugger (like Ozone, described below) that helps to set a
breakpoint at the beginning of the firmware.  A debugger does not know about a
vector table, so it relies on the ELF header.

```
MEMORY {
  flash(rx)  : ORIGIN = 0x08000000, LENGTH = 2048k
  sram(rwx) : ORIGIN = 0x20000000, LENGTH = 192k  /* remaining 64k in a separate address space */
}
```
This tells the linker that we have two memory regions in the address space,
their addresses and sizes.

```
_estack     = ORIGIN(sram) + LENGTH(sram);    /* stack points to end of SRAM */
```

This tell a linker to create a symbol `estack` with value at the very end
of the RAM memory region. That will be our initial stack value!

```
  .vectors  : { KEEP(*(.vectors)) }   > flash
  .text     : { *(.text*) }           > flash
  .rodata   : { *(.rodata*) }         > flash
```

These lines tell the linker to put vectors table on flash first,
followed by `.text` section (firmware code), followed by the read only
data `.rodata`.

The next goes `.data` section:

```
  .data : {
    _sdata = .;   /* .data section start */
    *(.first_data)
    *(.data SORT(.data.*))
    _edata = .;  /* .data section end */
  } > sram AT > flash
  _sidata = LOADADDR(.data);
```

Note that we tell linker to create `_sdata` and `_edata` symbols. We'll
use them to copy data section to RAM in the `_reset()` function.

Same for `.bss` section:

```
  .bss : {
    _sbss = .;              /* .bss section start */
    *(.bss SORT(.bss.*) COMMON)
    _ebss = .;              /* .bss section end */
  } > sram
```

### Startup code

Now we can update our `_reset()` function. We initialize stack pointer,
copy data section to RAM, and initialise bss section to zeroes. Then, we
call main() function - and fall into infinite loop in case if main() returns:

```c
int main(void) {
  return 0; // Do nothing so far
}

// Startup code
__attribute__((naked, noreturn)) void _reset(void) {
  asm("ldr sp, = _estack");  // Set initial stack pointer

  // memset .bss to zero, and copy .data section to RAM region
  extern long _sbss, _ebss, _sdata, _edata, _sidata;
  for (long *src = &_sbss; src < &_ebss; src++) *src = 0;
  for (long *src = &_sdata, *dst = &_sidata; src < &_edata;) *src++ = *dst++;

  main();             // Call main()
  for (;;) (void) 0;  // Infinite loop in the case if main() returns
}
```

The following diagram visualises how `_reset()` initialises .data and .bss:

![](images/mem2.svg)

Now we are ready to produce a full firmware file `firmware.elf`:

```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-gcc -T link.ld -nostdlib main.o -o firmware.elf
```

Let's examine sections in firmware.elf:

```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-objdump -h firmware.elf
...
Sections:
Idx Name          Size      VMA       LMA       File off  Algn
  0 .vectors      000001ac  08000000  08000000  00010000  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, DATA
  1 .text         00000058  080001ac  080001ac  000101ac  2**2
                  CONTENTS, ALLOC, LOAD, READONLY, CODE
...
```

Now we can see that the .vectors section will reside at the very beginning of
flash memory at address 0x8000000, then the .text section right after it, at
0x80001ac. Our code does not create any variables, so there is no data section.

## Flash firmware

We're ready to flash this firmware! First, extract sections from the
firmware.elf into a single contiguous binary blob:

```sh
$ arm-none-eabi-objcopy -O binary firmware.elf firmware.bin
```

And use `st-link` utility to flash the firmware.bin. Plug your board to the
USB, and execute:

```sh
$ st-flash --reset write firmware.bin 0x8000000
```

Done! We've flashed a firmware that does nothing.

## Makefile: build automation

Instead of typing those compilation, linking and flashing commands, we can
use `make` command line tool to automate the whole process. `make` utility
uses a configuration file named `Makefile` where it reads instructions
how to execute actions. This automation is great because it also documents the
process of building firmware, used compilation flags, etc.

The `Makefile` format is simple:

```make
action1:
	command ...     # Comments can go after hash symbol
	command ....    # IMPORTANT: command must be preceded with the TAB character

action2:
	command ...     # Don't forget about TAB. Spaces won't work!
```

Now, we can invoke `make` with the action name (also called *target*) to execute
a corresponding action:

```sh
$ make action1
```

It is possible to define variables and use them in commands. Also, actions
can be file names that needs to be created:

```make
firmware.elf:
	COMPILATION COMMAND .....
```

And, any action can have a list of dependencies. For example, `firmware.elf`
depends on our source file `main.c`. Whenever `main.c` file changes, the
`make build` command rebuilds `firmware.elf`:

```
build: firmware.elf

firmware.elf: main.c
	COMPILATION COMMAND
```

Now we are ready to write a Makefile for our firmware. We define a `build`
action / target:

```make
CFLAGS  ?=  -W -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wundef -Wshadow -Wdouble-promotion \
            -Wformat-truncation -fno-common -Wconversion \
            -g3 -Os -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -I. \
            -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16 $(EXTRA_CFLAGS)
LDFLAGS ?= -Tlink.ld -nostartfiles -nostdlib --specs nano.specs -lc -lgcc -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-Map=$@.map
SOURCES = main.c 

build: firmware.elf

firmware.elf: $(SOURCES)
	arm-none-eabi-gcc $(SOURCES) $(CFLAGS) $(LDFLAGS) -o $@
```

There, we define compilation flags. The `?=` means that's a default value;
we could override them from the command line like this:

```sh
$ make build CFLAGS="-O2 ...."
```

We specify `CFLAGS`, `LDFLAGS` and `SOURCES` variables.
Then we tell `make`: if you're told to `build`, then create a `firmware.elf`
file. It depends on the `main.c` file, and to create it, start
`arm-none-eabi-gcc` compiler with a given flags. `$@` special variable
expands to a target name - in our case, `firmware.elf`.

Let's call `make`:

```
$ make build
arm-none-eabi-gcc main.c  -W -Wall -Wextra -Werror -Wundef -Wshadow -Wdouble-promotion -Wformat-truncation -fno-common -Wconversion -g3 -Os -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -I. -mcpu=cortex-m4 -mthumb -mfloat-abi=hard -mfpu=fpv4-sp-d16  -Tlink.ld -nostartfiles -nostdlib --specs nano.specs -lc -lgcc -Wl,--gc-sections -Wl,-Map=firmware.elf.map -o firmware.elf
```

If we run it again:

```sh
$ make build
make: Nothing to be done for `build'.
```

The `make` utility examines modification times for `main.c` dependency and
`firmware.elf` - and does not do anything if `firmware.elf` is up to date.
But if we change `main.c`, then next `make build` will recompile:

```sh
$ touch main.c # Simulate changes in main.c
$ make build
```

Now, what is left - is the `flash` target:


```make
firmware.bin: firmware.elf
	$(DOCKER) $(CROSS)-objcopy -O binary $< $@

flash: firmware.bin
	st-flash --reset write $(TARGET).bin 0x8000000
```

That's it! Now, `make flash` terminal command creates a `firmware.bin` file,
and flashes it to the board. It'll recompile the firmware if `main.c` changes,
because `firmware.bin` depends on `firmware.elf`, and it in turn depends on
`main.c`. So, now the development cycle would be these two actions in a loop:

```sh
# Develop code in main.c
$ make flash
```

It is a good idea to add a clean target to remove build artifacts:


```
clean:
	rm -rf firmware.*
```

A complete project source code you can find in [step-0-minimal](step-0-minimal) folder.

## Blinky LED

Now as we have the whole build / flash infrastructure set up, it is time to
teach our firmware to do something useful. Something useful is of course blinking
an LED. A Nucleo-F429ZI board has three built-in LEDs. In a Nucleo board
datasheet section 6.5 we can see which pins built-in LEDs are attached to:

- PB0: green LED
- PB7: blue LED
- PB14: red LED

Let's modify `main.c` file and add our definitions for PIN, `gpio_set_mode()`.
In the main() function, we set the blue LED to output mode, and start an
infinite loop. First, let's copy the definitions for pins and GPIO we have
discussed earlier. Note we also add a convenience macro `BIT(position)`:

```c
#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdbool.h>

#define BIT(x) (1UL << (x))
#define PIN(bank, num) ((((bank) - 'A') << 8) | (num))
#define PINNO(pin) (pin & 255)
#define PINBANK(pin) (pin >> 8)

struct gpio {
  volatile uint32_t MODER, OTYPER, OSPEEDR, PUPDR, IDR, ODR, BSRR, LCKR, AFR[2];
};
#define GPIO(bank) ((struct gpio *) (0x40020000 + 0x400 * (bank)))

// Enum values are per datasheet: 0, 1, 2, 3
enum { GPIO_MODE_INPUT, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT, GPIO_MODE_AF, GPIO_MODE_ANALOG };

static inline void gpio_set_mode(uint16_t pin, uint8_t mode) {
  struct gpio *gpio = GPIO(PINBANK(pin));  // GPIO bank
  int n = PINNO(pin);                      // Pin number
  gpio->MODER &= ~(3U << (n * 2));         // Clear existing setting
  gpio->MODER |= (mode & 3) << (n * 2);    // Set new mode
}
```

Some microcontrollers, when they are powered, have all their peripherals
powered and enabled, automatically. STM32 MCUs, however, by default have their
peripherals disabled in order to save power. In order to enable a GPIO peripheral,
it should be enabled (clocked) via the RCC (Reset and Clock Control) unit.
In the datasheet section 7.3.10 we find that the AHB1ENR (AHB1 peripheral
clock enable register) is responsible to turn GPIO banks on or off. First we
add a definition for the whole RCC unit:

```c
struct rcc {
  volatile uint32_t CR, PLLCFGR, CFGR, CIR, AHB1RSTR, AHB2RSTR, AHB3RSTR,
      RESERVED0, APB1RSTR, APB2RSTR, RESERVED1[2], AHB1ENR, AHB2ENR, AHB3ENR,
      RESERVED2, APB1ENR, APB2ENR, RESERVED3[2], AHB1LPENR, AHB2LPENR,
      AHB3LPENR, RESERVED4, APB1LPENR, APB2LPENR, RESERVED5[2], BDCR, CSR,
      RESERVED6[2], SSCGR, PLLI2SCFGR;
};
#define RCC ((struct rcc *) 0x40023800)
```

In the AHB1ENR register documentation we see that bits from 0 to 8 inclusive
set the clock for GPIO banks GPIOA - GPIOE:

```c
int main(void) {
  uint16_t led = PIN('B', 7);            // Blue LED
  RCC->AHB1ENR |= BIT(PINBANK(led));     // Enable GPIO clock for LED
  gpio_set_mode(led, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);  // Set blue LED to output mode
  for (;;) asm volatile("nop");          // Infinite loop
  return 0;
}
```

Now, what is left to do, is to find out how to set a GPIO pin on and off, and
then modify the main loop to set an LED pin on, delay, off, delay.  Looking at
the datasheet section 8.4.7, wee see that the register BSRR is responsible for
setting voltage high or low. The low 16 bit are used to set the ODR register
(i.e. set pin high), and high 16 bit are used  to reset the ODR
register (i.e. set pin low). Let's define an API function for that:

```c
static inline void gpio_write(uint16_t pin, bool val) {
  struct gpio *gpio = GPIO(PINBANK(pin));
  gpio->BSRR |= (1U << PINNO(pin)) << (val ? 0 : 16);
}
```

Next we need to implement a delay function. We do not require an accurate
delay at this moment, so let's define a function `spin()` that just executes
a NOP instruction a given number of times:

```c
static inline void spin(volatile uint32_t count) {
  while (count--) asm("nop");
}
```

Finally, we're ready to modify our main loop to implement LED blinking:

```c
  for (;;) {
    gpio_write(pin, true);
    spin(999999);
    gpio_write(pin, false);
    spin(999999);
  }
```

Run `make flash` and enjoy blue LED flashing.
A complete project source code you can find in [step-1-blinky](step-1-blinky).

## Blinky with SysTick interrupt

In order to implement an accurate time keeping, we should enable ARM's SysTick
interrupt. SysTick a 24-bit hardware counter, and is part of ARM core,
therefore it is documented by the ARM datasheet. Looking at the datasheet, we
see that SysTick has four registers:

- CTRL - used to enable/disable systick
- LOAD - an initial counter value
- VAL - a current counter value, decremented on each clock cycle
- CALIB - calibration register

Every time VAL drops to zero, a SysTick interrupt is generated. The SysTick
interrupt index in the vector table is 15, so we need to set it. Upon boot,
our board Nucleo-F429ZI runs at 16Mhz. We can configure the SysTick counter
to trigger interrupt each millisecond.

First, let's define a SysTick peripheral. We know 4 registers, and from the
datasheet we can learn that the SysTick address is 0xe000e010. So:

```c
struct systick {
  volatile uint32_t CTRL, LOAD, VAL, CALIB;
};
#define SYSTICK ((struct systick *) 0xe000e010)
```

Next, add an API function that configures it. We need to enable SysTick
in the `SYSTICK->CTRL` register, and also we must clock it via the
`RCC->APB2ENR`, described in the section 7.4.14:

```c
#define BIT(x) (1UL << (x))
static inline void systick_init(uint32_t ticks) {
  if ((ticks - 1) > 0xffffff) return;  // Systick timer is 24 bit
  SYSTICK->LOAD = ticks - 1;
  SYSTICK->VAL = 0;
  SYSTICK->CTRL = BIT(0) | BIT(1) | BIT(2);  // Enable systick
  RCC->APB2ENR |= BIT(14);                   // Enable SYSCFG
}
```

By default, Nucleo-F429ZI board runs at 16Mhz. That means, if we call
`systick_init(16000000 / 1000);`, then SysTick interrupt will be generated
every millisecond. We should have interrupt handler function defined - here
it is, we simply increment a 32-bit millisecond counter:

```c
static volatile uint32_t s_ticks;
void SysTick_Handler(void) {
  s_ticks++;
}
```

And we should add this handler to the vector table:

```c
__attribute__((section(".vectors"))) void (*tab[16 + 91])(void) = {
    0, _reset, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, SysTick_Handler};
```

Now we have a precise millisecond clock! Let's create a helper function
for arbitrary periodic timers:

```c
// t: expiration time, prd: period, now: current time. Return true if expired
bool timer_expired(uint32_t *t, uint64_t prd, uint64_t now) {
  if (now + prd < *t) *t = 0;                    // Time wrapped? Reset timer
  if (*t == 0) *t = now + prd;                   // First poll? Set expiration
  if (*t > now) return false;                    // Not expired yet, return
  *t = (now - *t) > prd ? now + prd : *t + prd;  // Next expiration time
  return true;                                   // Expired, return true
}
```

Now we are ready to update our main loop and use a precise timer for LED blink.
For example, let's use 250 milliseconds blinking interval:

```c
  uint32_t timer, period = 250;          // Declare timer and 250ms period
  for (;;) {
    if (timer_expired(&timer, period, s_ticks)) {
      static bool on;       // This block is executed
      gpio_write(led, on);  // Every `period` milliseconds
      on = !on;             // Toggle LED state
    }
    // Here we could perform other activities!
  }
```

Note that using SysTick, and a helper `timer_expired()` function, we made our
main loop (also called superloop) non-blocking. That means that inside that
loop we can perform many actions - for example, have different timers with
different periods, and they all will be triggered in time.

A complete project source code you can find in [step-2-systick](step-2-systick) folder.

## Add UART debug output

Now it's time to add a human-readable diagnostics to our firmware. One of the
MCU peripherals is a serial UART interface. Looking at the datasheet section
2.3, we see that there are several UART/USART controllers - i.e. pieces of
circuitry inside MCU that, properly configured, can exchange data via
certain pins. A mimimal UART setup uses two pins, RX (receive) and TX (transmit).

In a Nucleo board datasheet section 6.9 we see that one of the
controllers, USART3, is using pins PD8 (TX) and PD9 (RX) and is connected to
the on-board ST-LINK debugger. That means that if we configure USART3 and
output data via the PD9 pin, we can see it on our workstation via the ST-LINK
USB connection.

Thus, let us create a handy API for the UART, the way we did it for GPIO.
Datasheet section 30.6 summarises UART registers - so here is our UART struct:

```c
struct uart {
  volatile uint32_t SR, DR, BRR, CR1, CR2, CR3, GTPR;
};
#define UART1 ((struct uart *) 0x40011000)
#define UART2 ((struct uart *) 0x40004400)
#define UART3 ((struct uart *) 0x40004800)
```

To configure UART, we need to:
- Enable UART clock by setting appropriate bit in `RCC->APB2ENR` register
- Set "alternate function" pin mode for RX and TX pins. There can be several
  alternate functions (AF) for any given pin, depending on the peripheral that
  is used. The AF list can be found in the
  [STM32F429ZI](https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f429zi.pdf)
  table 12
- Set baud rate (receive/transmit clock frequency) via the BRR register
- Enable the peripheral, receive and transmit via the CR1 register

We already know how to set a GPIO pin into a specific mode. If a pin is in the
AF mode, we also need to specify the "function number", i.e. which exactly
peripheral takes control. This can be done via the "alternate function register",
`AFR`, of the GPIO peripheral. Reading the AFR register description in the
datasheet, we can see that the AF number occupies 4 bits, thus the whole setup
for 16 pins occupies 2 registers. If a p

```c
static inline void gpio_set_af(uint16_t pin, uint8_t af_num) {
  struct gpio *gpio = GPIO(PINBANK(pin));  // GPIO bank
  int n = PINNO(pin);                      // Pin number
  gpio->AFR[n >> 3] &= ~(15UL << ((n & 7) * 4));
  gpio->AFR[n >> 3] |= ((uint32_t) af_num) << ((n & 7) * 4);
}
```

In order to completely hide register-specific code from the GPIO API, let's
move the GPIO clock init to the `gpio_set_mode()` function:

```c
static inline void gpio_set_mode(uint16_t pin, uint8_t mode) {
  struct gpio *gpio = GPIO(PINBANK(pin));  // GPIO bank
  int n = PINNO(pin);                      // Pin number
  RCC->AHB1ENR |= BIT(PINBANK(pin));       // Enable GPIO clock
  ...
```

Now we're ready to create a UART initialization API function:

```c
#define FREQ 16000000  // CPU frequency, 16 Mhz
static inline void uart_init(struct uart *uart, unsigned long baud) {
  // https://www.st.com/resource/en/datasheet/stm32f429zi.pdf
  uint8_t af = 0;           // Alternate function
  uint16_t rx = 0, tx = 0;  // pins

  if (uart == UART1) RCC->APB2ENR |= BIT(4);
  if (uart == UART2) RCC->APB1ENR |= BIT(17);
  if (uart == UART3) RCC->APB1ENR |= BIT(18);

  if (uart == UART1) af = 4, tx = PIN('A', 9), rx = PIN('A', 10);
  if (uart == UART2) af = 4, tx = PIN('A', 2), rx = PIN('A', 3);
  if (uart == UART3) af = 7, tx = PIN('D', 8), rx = PIN('D', 9);

  gpio_set_mode(tx, GPIO_MODE_AF);
  gpio_set_af(tx, af);
  gpio_set_mode(rx, GPIO_MODE_AF);
  gpio_set_af(rx, af);
  uart->CR1 = 0;                           // Disable this UART
  uart->BRR = FREQ / baud;                 // FREQ is a CPU frequency 
  uart->CR1 |= BIT(13) | BIT(2) | BIT(3);  // Set UE, RE, TE
}
```

And, finally, functions for reading and writing to the UART.
The datasheet section 30.6.1 tells us that the status register SR tells us
whether data is ready:
```c
static inline int uart_read_ready(struct uart *uart) {
  return uart->SR & BIT(5);  // If RXNE bit is set, data is ready
}
```

The data byte itself can be fetched from the data register DR:
```c
static inline uint8_t uart_read_byte(struct uart *uart) {
  return (uint8_t) (uart->DR & 255);
}
```

Transmitting a single byte can be done via the data register too. After
setting a byte to write, we need to wait for the transmission to end, indicated
via bit 7 in the status register:
```c
static inline void uart_write_byte(struct uart *uart, uint8_t byte) {
  uart->DR = byte;
  while ((uart->SR & BIT(7)) == 0) spin(1);
}
```

And writing a buffer:
```c
static inline void uart_write_buf(struct uart *uart, char *buf, size_t len) {
  while (len-- > 0) uart_write_byte(uart, *(uint8_t *) buf++);
}
```

Now, initialise UART in our main() function:

```c
  ...
  uart_init(UART3, 115200);              // Initialise UART
```

Now, we're ready to print a message "hi\r\n" every time LED blinks!
```c
    if (timer_expired(&timer, period, s_ticks)) {
      ...
      uart_write_buf(UART3, "hi\r\n", 4);  // Write message
    }
```

Rebuild, reflash, and attach a terminal program to the ST-LINK port.
On my Mac workstation, I use `cu`. It also can be used on Linux. On Windows,
using `putty` utility can be a good idea. Run a terminal and see the messages:

```sh
$ cu -l /dev/cu.YOUR_SERIAL_PORT -s 115200
hi
hi
```

A complete project source code you can find in [step-3-uart](step-3-uart) folder.

## Redirect printf() to UART

In this section, we replace `uart_write_buf()` call by `printf()` call, which
gives us an ability to do formatted output - and increase our abilities to
print diagnostic information, implemeting so called "printf-style debugging".

A GNU ARM toolchain that we're using comes not only with a GCC compiler and
other tools, but with a C library called newlib,
https://sourceware.org/newlib. A newlib library was developed by RedHat for
embedded systems.

If our firmware calls a standard C library function, for example `strcmp()`,
then a newlib code will be added to our firmware by the GCC linker.

Some of the standard C functions that newlib implements, specifically, file
input/output (IO) operations, implemented by the newlib is a special fashion: those
functions eventually call a set of low-level IO functions called "sycalls".

For example:
- `fopen()` eventually calls `_open()`
- `fread()` eventually calls a low level `_read()`
- `fwrite()`, `fprintf()`, `printf()` eventually call a low level `_write()`
- `malloc()` eventually calls `_sbrk()`, and so on.

Thus, by modifying a `_write()` syscall, we can redirect
printf() to whatever we want. That mechanism is called "IO retargeting".

Note: STM32 Cube also uses ARM GCC with newlib, that's why Cube projects
typically include `syscalls.c` file.  Other toolchains, like TI's CCS, Keil's
CC, might use a different  C library with a bit different retargeting
mechanism. We use newlib, so let's modify `_write()` syscall to print to the
UART3.

Before that, let's organise our source code in the following way:
- move all API definitions to the file `mcu.h`
- move startup code to `startup.c`
- create an empty file `syscalls.c` for newlib "syscalls"
- modify Makefile to addd `syscalls.c` and `startup.c` to the build

After moving all API definitions to the `mcu.h`, our `main.c` file becomes
quite compact. Note that it does not have any mention of the low-level
registers, just a high level API functions that are easy to understand:

```c
#include "mcu.h"

static volatile uint32_t s_ticks;
void SysTick_Handler(void) {
  s_ticks++;
}

int main(void) {
  uint16_t led = PIN('B', 7);            // Blue LED
  systick_init(16000000 / 1000);         // Tick every 1 ms
  gpio_set_mode(led, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT);  // Set blue LED to output mode
  uart_init(UART3, 115200);              // Initialise UART
  uint32_t timer = 0, period = 250;      // Declare timer and 250ms period
  for (;;) {
    if (timer_expired(&timer, period, s_ticks)) {
      static bool on;                      // This block is executed
      gpio_write(led, on);                 // Every `period` milliseconds
      on = !on;                            // Toggle LED state
      uart_write_buf(UART3, "hi\r\n", 4);  // Write message
    }
    // Here we could perform other activities!
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Great, now let's retarget printf to the UART3. In the empty syscalls.c,
copy/paste the following code:

```c
#include "mcu.h"

int _write(int fd, char *ptr, int len) {
  (void) fd, (void) ptr, (void) len;
  if (fd == 1) uart_write_buf(UART3, ptr, (size_t) len);
  return -1;
}
```

Here we say: if the file descriptor we're writing to is 1 (which is a
standard output descriptor), then write the buffer to the UART3. Otherwise,
ignore. This is the essence of retargeting!

Rebuilding this firmware results in a bunch of linker errors:

```sh
../../arm-none-eabi/lib/thumb/v7e-m+fp/hard/libc_nano.a(lib_a-sbrkr.o): in function `_sbrk_r':
sbrkr.c:(.text._sbrk_r+0xc): undefined reference to `_sbrk'
closer.c:(.text._close_r+0xc): undefined reference to `_close'
lseekr.c:(.text._lseek_r+0x10): undefined reference to `_lseek'
readr.c:(.text._read_r+0x10): undefined reference to `_read'
fstatr.c:(.text._fstat_r+0xe): undefined reference to `_fstat'
isattyr.c:(.text._isatty_r+0xc): undefined reference to `_isatty'
```

Since we've used a newlib stdio function, we need to supply newlib with the rest
of syscalls. Let's add just a simple stubs that do nothing:

```c
int _fstat(int fd, struct stat *st) {
  (void) fd, (void) st;
  return -1;
}

void *_sbrk(int incr) {
  (void) incr;
  return NULL;
}

int _close(int fd) {
  (void) fd;
  return -1;
}

int _isatty(int fd) {
  (void) fd;
  return 1;
}

int _read(int fd, char *ptr, int len) {
  (void) fd, (void) ptr, (void) len;
  return -1;
}

int _lseek(int fd, int ptr, int dir) {
  (void) fd, (void) ptr, (void) dir;
  return 0;
}
```

Now, rebuild gives no errors. Last step: replace the `uart_write_buf()`
call in the `main()` function with `printf()` call that prints something
useful, e.g. a LED status and a current value of systick:

```c
printf("LED: %d, tick: %lu\r\n", on, s_ticks);  // Write message
```

The serial output looks like this:

```sh
LED: 1, tick: 250
LED: 0, tick: 500
LED: 1, tick: 750
LED: 0, tick: 1000
```

Congratulations! We learned how IO retargeting works, and
can now printf-debug our firmware.
A complete project source code you can find in [step-4-printf](step-4-printf) folder.

## Debug with Segger Ozone

What if our firmware is stuck somewhere and printf debug does not work?
What if even a startup code does not work? We would need a debugger. There
are many options, but I'd recommend using an Ozone debugger from Segger.
Why? Because it is stand-alone. It does not need any IDE set up. We can
feed our `firmware.elf` directly to Ozone, and it'll pick up our source files.

So, [download Ozone](https://www.segger.com/products/development-tools/ozone-j-link-debugger/)
from the Segger website. Before we can use it with our Nucleo board,
we need to convert ST-LINK firmware on the onboard debugger to the jlink firmware
that Ozone understands. Follow the [instructions](https://www.segger.com/products/debug-probes/j-link/models/other-j-links/st-link-on-board/)
on the Segger site.

Now, run Ozone. Choose our device in the wizard:

<img src="images/ozone1.png" width="50%" />

Select a debugger we're going to use - that should be a ST-LINK:

<img src="images/ozone2.png" width="50%" />

Choose our firmware.elf file:

<img src="images/ozone3.png" width="50%" />

Leave the defaults on the next screen, click Finish, and we've got our
debugger loaded (note the mcu.h source code is picked up):

![](images/ozone4.png)

Click the green button to download, run the firmware, and we're stopped here:

![](images/ozone5.png)

Now we can single-step through code, set breakpoints, and do the usual debugging
stuff. One thing that could be noted, is a handy Ozone peripheral view:

![](images/ozone6.png)

Using it, we can directly examine or set the state of the peripherals. For
example, let's turn on a green on-board LED (PB0):

1. We need to clock GPIOB first. Find Peripherals -> RCC -> AHB1ENR,
   and enable GPIOBEN bit - set it to 1:
  <img src="images/ozone7.png" width="75%" />
2. Find Peripherals -> GPIO -> GPIOB -> MODER, set MODER0 to 1 (output): 
  <img src="images/ozone8.png" width="75%" />
3. Find Peripherals -> GPIO -> GPIOB -> ODR, set ODR0 to 1 (on): 
  <img src="images/ozone9.png" width="75%" />

Now, a green LED should be on! Happy debugging.

## Vendor CMSIS headers

In the previous sections, we have developed the firmware using only datasheets,
editor, and GCC compiler. We have created peripheral structure definitions
manually, using datasheets.

Now as you know how it all works, it is time to introduce CMSIS headers.
What is it ? These are header files with all definitions, created and supplied
by the MCU vendor. They contain definitions for everything that MCU contains,
therefore they rather big.

CMSIS stands for Common Microcontroller Software Interface Standard, thus it is
a common ground for the MCU manufacturers to specify peripheral API.  Since
CMSIS is an ARM standard, and since CMSIS headers are supplied by the MCU
vendor, they are the source of authority. Therefore, using vendor
headers is is a preferred way, rather than writing definitions manually.

In this section, we will replace our API functions in the `mcu.h` by the
CMSIS vendor header, and leave the rest of the firmware intact.

STM32 CMSIS headers for F4 family can be found at
https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_f4 repo. From there,
copy the following files into our firmware directory,
[step-5-cmsis](step-5-cmsis):
- [stm32f429xx.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_f4/master/Include/stm32f429xx.h)
- [system_stm32f4xx.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STMicroelectronics/cmsis_device_f4/master/Include/system_stm32f4xx.h)

Those two files depend on a standard ARM CMSIS includes, download them too:
- [core_cm4.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeF4/master/Drivers/CMSIS/Core/Include/core_cm4.h)

From the `mcu.h`, remove all peripheral API and definitions, and leave only
standard C inludes, vendor CMSIS include, defines to PIN, BIT, FREQ, and
`timer_expired()` helper function:

```c
#pragma once

#include <inttypes.h>
#include <stdbool.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

#include "stm32f429xx.h"

#define FREQ 16000000  // CPU frequency, 16 Mhz
#define BIT(x) (1UL << (x))
#define PIN(bank, num) ((((bank) - 'A') << 8) | (num))
#define PINNO(pin) (pin & 255)
#define PINBANK(pin) (pin >> 8)

static inline void spin(volatile uint32_t count) {
  while (count--) asm("nop");
}

static inline bool timer_expired(uint32_t *t, uint32_t prd, uint32_t now) {
  ...
}
```

If we try to rebuild the firmware - `make clean build`, then GCC will fail
complaining about missing `systick_init()`, `GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT`, `uart_init()`,
and `UART3`. Let's add those using STM32 CMSIS files.

Let's start from `systick_init()`. The `core_cm4.h` header defines
`SysTick_Type` structure which is identical to our `struct systick`, and has
an appropriate #define for `SysTick` peripheral. Also, `stm32f429xx.h` has
a `RCC_TypeDef` structure and appropriate #define for the `RCC`. Therefore
our `systick_init()` function remains almost unchanged: we only have to replace
`SYSTICK` with `SysTick`:

```c
static inline void systick_init(uint32_t ticks) {
  if ((ticks - 1) > 0xffffff) return;  // Systick timer is 24 bit
  SysTick->LOAD = ticks - 1;
  SysTick->VAL = 0;
  SysTick->CTRL = BIT(0) | BIT(1) | BIT(2);  // Enable systick
  RCC->APB2ENR |= BIT(14);                   // Enable SYSCFG
}
```

Next goes `gpio_set_mode()` function. The  `stm32f429xx.h` header has
`GPIO_TypeDef` structure, identical to our `struct gpio`. Let's use it:

```c
#define GPIO(bank) ((GPIO_TypeDef *) (GPIOA_BASE + 0x400 * (bank)))
enum { GPIO_MODE_INPUT, GPIO_MODE_OUTPUT, GPIO_MODE_AF, GPIO_MODE_ANALOG };

static inline void gpio_set_mode(uint16_t pin, uint8_t mode) {
  GPIO_TypeDef *gpio = GPIO(PINBANK(pin));  // GPIO bank
  int n = PINNO(pin);                      // Pin number
  RCC->AHB1ENR |= BIT(PINBANK(pin));       // Enable GPIO clock
  gpio->MODER &= ~(3U << (n * 2));         // Clear existing setting
  gpio->MODER |= (mode & 3) << (n * 2);    // Set new mode
}
```

The `gpio_set_af()` and `gpio_write()` functions is also trivial -
simply replace `struct gpio` with `GPIO_TypeDef`, and that's all.

Next goes UART. There is a `USART_TypeDef`, and defines for  USART1, USART2,
USART3. Let's use them:

```c
#define UART1 USART1
#define UART2 USART2
#define UART3 USART3
```

In the `uart_init()` and the rest of UART functions, change `struct uart` to
`USART_TypeDef`. The rest stays the same!

And we are done. Rebuild, reflash the firmware. The LED blinks, the UART
shows the output. Congratulations, we have adopted our firmware code to
use vendor CMSIS header files. Now let's reorganise the repository a bit
by moving all standard files into `include` directory and updating Makefile
to let GCC know about it:

```make
...
  -g3 -Os -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -I. -Iinclude \
```

We have left with
a project template that can be reused for the future projects.

## Setting up clocks

After boot, Nucleo-F429ZI CPU runs at 16MHz. The maximum frequency is 180MHz.
Note that system clock frequency is not the only factor we need to care about.
Peripherals are attached to different buses, APB1 and APB2 which are clocked
differently.  Their clock speeds are configured by the frequency prescaler
values, set in the RCC. The main CPU clock source can also be
different - we can use either an external crystal oscillator (HSE) or an
internal oscillator (HSI). In our case, we'll use HSI.

When CPU executes instructions from flash, a flash read speed (which is around
25MHz) becomes a bottleneck if CPU clock gets higher. There are several tricks
that can help. Instruction prefetch is one. Also, we can give a clue to the
flash controller, how faster the system clock is: that value is called flash
latency. For 180MHz system clock, the `FLASH_LATENCY` value is 5. Bits 8 and 9
in the flash controller enable instruction and data caches:

```c
  FLASH->ACR |= FLASH_LATENCY | BIT(8) | BIT(9);      // Flash latency, caches
```

The clock source (HSI or HSE) goes through a piece of hardware called
PLL, which multiplies source frequency by a certain value. Then, a set of
frequency dividers are used to set the system clock and APB1, APB2 clocks.
In order to obtain the maximum system clock of 180MHz, multiple values
of PLL dividers and APB prescalers are possible. Section 6.3.3 of the
datasheet tells us the maximum values for APB1 clock: <= 45MHz,
and the APB2 clock: <= 90MHz. That narrows down the list of possible
combinations. Here we chose the values manually. Note that tools like
CubeMX can automate the process and make it easy and visual.

```c
enum { APB1_PRE = 5 /* AHB clock / 4 */, APB2_PRE = 4 /* AHB clock / 2 */ };
enum { PLL_HSI = 16, PLL_M = 8, PLL_N = 180, PLL_P = 2 };  // Run at 180 Mhz
#define PLL_FREQ (PLL_HSI * PLL_N / PLL_M / PLL_P)
#define FREQ (PLL_FREQ * 1000000)
```

Now we're ready for a simple algorithm to set up the clock for CPU and peripheral buses
may look like this:

- Optionally, enable FPU
- Set flash latency
- Decide on a clock source, and PLL, APB1 and APB2 prescalers
- Configure RCC by setting respective values:

```c
static inline void clock_init(void) {                 // Set clock frequency
  SCB->CPACR |= ((3UL << 10 * 2) | (3UL << 11 * 2));  // Enable FPU
  FLASH->ACR |= FLASH_LATENCY | BIT(8) | BIT(9);      // Flash latency, caches
  RCC->PLLCFGR &= ~((BIT(17) - 1));                   // Clear PLL multipliers
  RCC->PLLCFGR |= (((PLL_P - 2) / 2) & 3) << 16;      // Set PLL_P
  RCC->PLLCFGR |= PLL_M | (PLL_N << 6);               // Set PLL_M and PLL_N
  RCC->CR |= BIT(24);                                 // Enable PLL
  while ((RCC->CR & BIT(25)) == 0) spin(1);           // Wait until done
  RCC->CFGR = (APB1_PRE << 10) | (APB2_PRE << 13);    // Set prescalers
  RCC->CFGR |= 2;                                     // Set clock source to PLL
  while ((RCC->CFGR & 12) == 0) spin(1);              // Wait until done
}
```

What is left, is to call `clock_init()` from main, then rebuild and reflash.
And our board runs at its maximum speed, 180MHz!

## Web server with device dashboard

The Nucleo-F429ZI comes with Ethernet on-board. Ethernet hardware needs
two components: a PHY (which transmits/receives electrical signals to the
media like copper, optical cable, etc) and MAC (which drives PHY controller).
On our Nucleo, the MAC controller is built-in, and the PHY is external
(specifically, is is Microchip's LAN8720a).

MAC and PHY can talk several interfaces, we'll use RMII. For that, a bunch
of pins must be configured to use their Alternative Function (AF).
To implement a web server, we need 3 software components:
- a network driver, which sends/receives Ethernet frames to/from MAC controller
- a network stack, that parses frames and understands TCP/IP
- a network library that understands HTTP

We will use [Mongoose Network Library](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose)
which implements all of that in a single file. It is a dual-licensed library
(GPLv2/commercial) that was designed to make network embedded development
fast and easy.

So, copy
[mongoose.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesanta/mongoose/master/mongoose.c)
and
[mongoose.h](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesanta/mongoose/master/mongoose.h)
to our project. Now we have a driver, a network stack, and a library at hand.
Mongoose also provides a large set of examples, and one of them is a
[device dashboard example](https://github.com/cesanta/mongoose/tree/master/examples/device-dashboard).
It implements lots of things - like dashboard login, real-time data exchange
over WebSocket, embedded file system, MQTT communication, etcetera.  So let's
use that example. Copy two extra files:
- [net.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesanta/mongoose/master/examples/device-dashboard/net.c) - implements dashboard functionality
- [packed_fs.c](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cesanta/mongoose/master/examples/device-dashboard/packed_fs.c) - contains HTML/CSS/JS GUI files

What we need is to tell Mongoose which functionality to enable. That can
be done via compilation flags, by setting preprocessor constants. Alternatively,
the same constants can be set in the `mongoose_custom.h` file. Let's go
the second way. Create `mongoose_custom.h` file with the following contents:

```c
#pragma once
#define MG_ARCH MG_ARCH_NEWLIB
#define MG_ENABLE_MIP 1
#define MG_ENABLE_PACKED_FS 1
#define MG_IO_SIZE 512
#define MG_ENABLE_CUSTOM_MILLIS 1
```

Now it's time to add some networking code to main.c. We `#include "mongoose.c"`,
initialise Ethernet RMII pins and enable Ethernet in the RCC:

```c
  uint16_t pins[] = {PIN('A', 1),  PIN('A', 2),  PIN('A', 7),
                     PIN('B', 13), PIN('C', 1),  PIN('C', 4),
                     PIN('C', 5),  PIN('G', 11), PIN('G', 13)};
  for (size_t i = 0; i < sizeof(pins) / sizeof(pins[0]); i++) {
    gpio_init(pins[i], GPIO_MODE_AF, GPIO_OTYPE_PUSH_PULL, GPIO_SPEED_INSANE,
              GPIO_PULL_NONE, 11);
  }
  nvic_enable_irq(61);                          // Setup Ethernet IRQ handler
  RCC->APB2ENR |= BIT(14);                      // Enable SYSCFG
  SYSCFG->PMC |= BIT(23);                       // Use RMII. Goes first!
  RCC->AHB1ENR |= BIT(25) | BIT(26) | BIT(27);  // Enable Ethernet clocks
  RCC->AHB1RSTR |= BIT(25);                     // ETHMAC force reset
  RCC->AHB1RSTR &= ~BIT(25);                    // ETHMAC release reset
```

Mongoose's driver uses Ethernet interrupt, thus we need to update `startup.c`
and add `ETH_IRQHandler` to the vector table. Let's reorganise vector table
definition in `startup.c` in a way that does not require any modification
to add an interrupt handler function. The idea is to use a "weak symbol"
concept:

```c
void __attribute__((weak)) DefaultIRQHandler(void) {
  for (;;) (void) 0;
}
#define WEAK_ALIAS __attribute__((weak, alias("DefaultIRQHandler")))

WEAK_ALIAS void NMI_Handler(void);
WEAK_ALIAS void HardFault_Handler(void);
WEAK_ALIAS void MemManage_Handler(void);
...
__attribute__((section(".vectors"))) void (*tab[16 + 91])(void) = {
    0, _reset, NMI_Handler, HardFault_Handler, MemManage_Handler,
    ...
```

Notice that the vector table now has entries for every possible IRQ handler,
like `NMI_Handler()`, `HardFault_Handler()`, etcetera; but all of them are
"aliased" to the function `DefaultIRQHandler()` which is marked weak. This
mechanism allows to provide a default handler function for all interrupts.  If,
however, user code defines a function with the same name as it appears in the
vector table, then the linker will choose user function, not the default weak
one.  In our case, there is a `ETH_IRQHandler()` weak handler defined in the
vector table, and Mongoose's STM32 driver code defines its own
`ETH_IRQHandler()` which replaces it.

The next step is to initialise Mongoose library: create an event manager,
setup network driver, and start a listening HTTP connection:

```c
  struct mg_mgr mgr;        // Initialise Mongoose event manager
  mg_mgr_init(&mgr);        // and attach it to the MIP interface
  mg_log_set(MG_LL_DEBUG);  // Set log level

  struct mip_driver_stm32 driver_data = {.mdc_cr = 4};  // See driver_stm32.h
  struct mip_if mif = {
      .mac = {2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 5},
      .use_dhcp = true,
      .driver = &mip_driver_stm32,
      .driver_data = &driver_data,
  };
  mip_init(&mgr, &mif);
  extern void device_dashboard_fn(struct mg_connection *, int, void *, void *);
  mg_http_listen(&mgr, "http://0.0.0.0", device_dashboard_fn, &mgr);
  MG_INFO(("Init done, starting main loop"));
```

What is left, is to add a `mg_mgr_poll()` call into the main loop.

Now, add `mongoose.c`, `net.c` and `packed_fs.c` files to the Makefile.
Rebuild, reflash the board.  Attach a serial console to the debug output,
observe that the board obtains an IP address over DHCP:

```
847 3 mongoose.c:6784:arp_cache_add     ARP cache: added 0xc0a80001 @ 90:5c:44:55:19:8b
84e 2 mongoose.c:6817:onstatechange     READY, IP: 192.168.0.24
854 2 mongoose.c:6818:onstatechange            GW: 192.168.0.1
859 2 mongoose.c:6819:onstatechange            Lease: 86363 sec
LED: 1, tick: 2262
LED: 0, tick: 2512
```

Fire up a browser at that IP address, and get a working dashboard, with
real-time graph over WebSocket, with MQTT, authentication, and other things!
